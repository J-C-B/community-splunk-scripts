# Build scripts to create a basic splunk node or heavy forwarder

## Purpose

This repo is for community scripts to be shared from.

****These scripts are community focused and not supported or endorsed by Splunk, use at your own risk****

## Notes

* The splunk admin password is hardcoded into the script, ensure it is changes before / after the installation
* The addons installed are from a static `.tar` so may be out of date, update if required after script run
* For splunk cloud customers, contact support for a free heavy forwarder licence
* These scripts are designed to be run on a vanilla fresh install, they take no care for any existing configuration
